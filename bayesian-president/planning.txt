- use R
- use bayesian stats
- build linear regression for who should win based on unemployment rate, wage
  growth, current party in power (or how long in power).
- get priors for each state based on recency-weighted election results from
  last 3 elections. Ensure enough variance
- priors also influenced by population growth (& demographic changes ?)
- update priors for each state based on state polling.  Weight by poll type
  (registered vs likely, cell phones/internet, pollster ratings?)
- update priors for each state based on national polling, using some measure of
  elasticity for each state.
- monte carlo election results, like I do now
